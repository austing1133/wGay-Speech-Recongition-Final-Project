# wGay-Speech-Recongition-Final-Project
Final Project for my Speech Recognition Masters Course. The projects goal is to identify the speaker and the word being spoken using different models.

Created a program using MATLAB to take in a live audio input and identify the speaker and the word being said. This project was for my Speech Recognition Masters Class at Florida Tech.

The data:

The data used to train the models in this Project consist of data created by myself (I recorded my own audio). The data consisted of several speakers saying different single words, in other words the spoken data consisted of a single spoken word alone. 

Models:

I trained 3 different models to compare their accuracy with this task. Naive Bayes Model, Gaussian Mixture Model, and K Nearest Neighbor.

Result:
I was able to successfully train the models to accurately identify both the speaker and the word being spoken. The models that worked the best were KNN and Naive Bayes.
